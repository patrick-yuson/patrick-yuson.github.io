# personal-website

This is the implementation of my personal website that is currently a work in progress. It is being created as a means to both practice web application development with Vue.js, but also serve as a portfolio of my work as a software engineer.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
