      "projectDescription": "For this project I worked with a team of two other students to use machine learning models in order to investigate whether household income or population had significant effects on COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths in Virginia. This project was created for the Fall 2023 Semester of CS 4774: Machine Learning at UVA. Ultimately, we discovered that using a K-Means clustering model began to depict clusters heavily influenced by population because with an increased population there is bound to be more cases and hospitalizations. In terms of Linear Regression, we found that the model that we developed could not be considered accurate due to a high root mean squared error (RMSE)."
